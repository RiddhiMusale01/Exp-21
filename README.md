1. Constant Time Complexity:[ O(1)]
A function that takes constant time, regardless of the input size.

2. Linear Time Complexity: [O(n)]
A function where time grows linearly with the size of the input.

3. Quadratic Time Complexity: [O(n²)]
A function that involves a nested loop, where each loop runs n times.

4. Logarithmic Time Complexity: [O(log n)]
This occurs when the problem size is reduced by a constant factor at each step (like in binary search).

5. Exponential Time Complexity: [O(2^n)]
This complexity occurs in algorithms like recursive backtracking, such as calculating Fibonacci numbers recursively.

# Conclusion
These examples demonstrate different time complexities, from constant time (O(1)) to exponential time (O(2^n)). Constant time remains unaffected by input size, while linear (O(n)), quadratic (O(n²)), and logarithmic (O(log n)) grow at different rates. Logarithmic time, like in binary search, is efficient for large datasets, while exponential time becomes impractical for larger inputs. Understanding these complexities helps in creating efficient algorithms.
